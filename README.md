# Organic Cooperation

This project attempts to formulate a set of core principles for organic cooperation, based on conversations and embodied experiments between me and various friends. The focus is on sociotechnical components of human collaboration, in the context of the 21st century. Over time, this focus may be refined. 

You are invited to submit comments, propose changes or fork the project, so that we may find a clear and effective set of principles through iterative cycles of improvement. A version control system is provided to keep track of our shared progress, please use it accordingly.

## 0. Humble beginnings

We recommend every participant to look within themselves before reaching out to the world. The following questions invite you to reflect on your willingness and readiness to engage in deep cooperation with your peers.

* What brings you here?
* What are you aiming for?
* What road are you on now?
* Why might you need others? 
* What could you mean for them?

## 1. Cooperation is a skill

If you want to bring out the best in your community, be mindful of your approach. You will need more than good intentions. A group of people with shared values can go a long way. To go further, it is important that every participant upholds their personal commitments to the community.

### 1.1. Community values

Each community has a unique culture, with a unique set of shared values. We propose the following key items, but it is highly recommended to discuss and refine this set with your peers until an open consensus is reached.

* Let people be people. Respect personal needs, differences and complexities.
* Promote personal sovereignty. Strong people make strong communities.
* Support life, including our planet and all we share it with.

### 1.2. Personal responsibilities

Once a consensus on community values is reached, it is up to each community member to define and uphold their personal commitments. Our social fabric is sensitive to external factors, and the complacency or withdrawal of individual members deeply impacts the resilience of the group. We ask of you to take responsibility for the commitments you make to your communities.

Note that you are free to define your commitments! Always give yourself a moment to consider your capacity before making any new commitments, and please give others the necessary space and time to do the same. 

## 2. Core principles

We propose a set of core principles that create a sociotechnical framework for healthy cooperation between peers. As stated before, these are open for review at all times. Iterative feedback cycles will help to refine the core principles, and keep them aligned with our broader context over time.

* Ensure that you and your peers have healthy foundations.
* Share clear information about your commitments and boundaries.
* Hold each other accountable, but respect your peers' boundaries.
* Listen carefully, and mind your assumptions. Ask questions if unclear.
* Formulate clear messages and questions. Speak the truth, and do not lie.
* Be mindful of who you address, as well as the how/when of channel selection.
* Keep your feedback constructive, and try to resolve conflict when it arises.
* Timely reflection is key! Fail fast, reflect, and try again. Never give up.

It is up to each participant to build their cooperative self, while upholding the values and principles of their community. As in nature, a healthy and skilled collective of peers will emerge out of collaborative feedback cycles. Don't be afraid to put this into practice, embodied experiments will tell you much more than theoretical discussions ever will. Good luck, and have a wonderful journey!
